After getting approval from our project mentor, Adit. We started working on our project after having to rewrite our proposal due pivoting to our new idea of using OpenFlights. We had to rewrite the whole proposal as well as of about 6 hours of thinking of how to use the different algorithms to accomplish our goal of this class project.

Our project proposal got approved, and we started to get going. However, we had some issues with our data so before we did anything. We focused on the type of data we needed to use. We made a miscalculation, and we had a new dataset, which we had to fix in order to do the parsing correctly. This week, we'll be focusing on finishing the data correction as well as making sure we have enough data to achieve our project goal after listening to the feedback of our project mentor.

Throughout the week, we worked on finishing the gathering of the data as well as including it in our repository. Most importantly, we were able to organize our projects in an organized manner so we can all start working parallelly on the project. Finally, we were able to compile our project after organizing and creating the script for CMake and make. 

This week, we'll be focusing on parsing and algorithms. Additionally, we had our group meeting check-in with our mentor where we had feedback about how to figure out the BFS as well as some of the tests we need to write when we finish everything. 

On Friday, parsing was completed and graphing the following morning. On Saturday, we met as a group to make progress on the graph algorithms.
